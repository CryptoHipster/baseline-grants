## Grant Title
Baseline Protocol Enterprise Education and Awareness Media Program


---

## Details on Grant Work
Every public company, whether in the Fortune 1000 or not, has an inefficient process somewhere within its company. Collectively, these processes may be in the sales departments, the manufacturing assembly line, franchise reporting, middle or back office reporting including settlements and payments, or various accounting, underwriting, or communication processes. Most companies live with these inefficiencies and do not resolve them, rather simply cut headcount and lessen their expenses. These cost cutting measures do not solve the inefficiencies that continue to persist.
If the managers in these companies were made aware of a simple solution to their efficiency problems, such as the Baseline Protocol, many would be interested in adopting this solution, and some may just take it on as one of their technology project initiatives.
In order to get the awareness out there, it requires organic awareness and communication. Not expensive Public Relations campaigns, per se, rather education, information creation and dissemination, and continuous messaging, and materials presented in clear, easy to understand and easy to internalize approach.
The scope of this program will be to build the Baseline Protocol to a better known brand through social media distribution.:
Publication and promotion of the Baseline Show.
Publication and promotion of the Baseline Podcast
Publication and promotion of Baseline Podcast (Open Office Hours)
Facilitating monthly General Assembly meetings

## Motivation and Overview
Enterprise adoption occurs in different ways. With hedge funds and banks, it has been dependent upon reducing investment risks. With payment companies, it has been reliant on addressing regulatory matters. 
But what about enterprise operations? Public company inefficient processes? How can these companies rely upon blockchain technology to create efficient and effective reporting, communications, accounting, auditing, and streamlined operations? F
From my corporate career experience, which included twelve years at AIG related companies, I’ve seen the importance of developing streamlined efficiencies within organizations makes a major impact on the company’s long-term success. In order to get there, education and awareness are necessary first steps in the process. That’s where developing informational and educational content that can be easily published and produced, and then placed in front of company managers, is of paramount importance. 
This program first revives a currently successful show, The Baseline Show, and increases its reach, breadth and scope, geographically and across sectors and industries.
Second, to supplement the Baseline Show, my experience as a podcaster will lend its hand in creating the Baseline Podcast, which we can call Open Office Hours. As part of this, I’ll also be looking to host the monthly General Assemblies.

## Value to the Baseline Protocol
Having an experienced, trained, educated and dedicated resource responsible for the communication efforts for its success is invaluable. It’s also much more cost efficient than hiring a PR firm for a series of expensive short-term engagements when they lack the proper corporate and enterprise operational efficiency experience to be a credible reference. In order to speak of ‘enterprise efficiency’, one has to have that experience. The value is immeasurable and priceless to have someone with direct expertise. 
The word gets out, consistently, and we are able to build an organic audience and client base, with many potential enterprise clients.

## Downsides / Execution Risks / Limitations
The downsides and execution risks are time and resources. I’m confident I can deliver a Baseline Show, Open Office Hours, and General Assembly as the host and facilitator. We should be able to get guests as the protocol participants are global. As podcast host at Irish Tech News from March 2021 to May 2022, I was able to interview guests from over forty countries, so geography was no issue. I will also be able to deliver on the Open Office Hours and General Assembly. So, attendance and guests are always a wildcard, but I have never had a real issue there.


---

## Deliverables / Schedule / Milestones
2 monthly episodes of the Baseline Show between July 2022 and end December 2022.
2 monthly Open Office Hours podcasts between July 2022 and end December 2022.
Facilitate monthly general assembly conferences.
